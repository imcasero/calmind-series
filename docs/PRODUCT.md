# 🏆 Project Calmind: Competitive Pokémon Ecosystem

## 1. Product Vision

**Project Calmind** is a specialized tournament management platform designed to host high-stakes Pokémon competitive series. Unlike generic tournament software, it is tailor-made to handle a dual-league ecosystem (1st and 2nd Division) with a unique promotion/relegation mechanic known as **"The Olympus Play-off."**

The goal is to provide a professional, broadcast-ready interface that transforms raw match data into a compelling competitive narrative.

## 2. Competitive Framework

The product is structured around a **Split-based calendar**, where each cycle follows a specific progression:

1.  **The Regular Season (Weeks 1-7)**: A high-density phase where 16 trainers (8 per division) compete in double-header Bo3 (Best of 3) matches.
2.  **The Finals Hub (Week 8)**: The standings are locked, and the top 4 of each division enter the Championship Bracket, while the bottom 4 fight for survival.
3.  **The Climax (Week 9)**:
    - **The Olympus Match**: The high-stakes finale where the winner of the 2nd Division faces the lowest-ranked survivor of the 1st Division for a spot in the elite tier.

## 3. Key Product Features

- **Intelligent Standings**: Real-time ranking updates using a custom weighted scoring system ($3/2/1/0$ points) and advanced tie-breaking (Set Balance).
- **Dynamic Brackets**: Automated tournament tree generation that projects potential matchups based on live league performance.
- **Historical Archive**: A deep-linkable database that allows users to revisit any Season or Split in the history of the competition.
- **Broadcast-Ready UI**: Designed for high visibility during live streams, featuring "Golden Zones" for leaders and "Danger Zones" for relegation candidates.

## 4. Target Audience

- **Competitive Players**: To track their progress, study opponents, and check their "Olimpo" projection.
- **Spectators**: To follow the league narrative and view live results during streams.
- **Administrators**: To manage high-stakes results with a single-source-of-truth database.

## 5. Success Metrics (The "Pelotazo" Goal)

The product is considered successful when it becomes the central hub for the Pokémon community's competitive discussion, providing a reliable, fast, and visually "epic" experience that enhances the prestige of the Calmind Series title.
